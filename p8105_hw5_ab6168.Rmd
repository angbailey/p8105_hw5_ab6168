## Problem 1

Writing function:
```{r}
#n: number of people in the group
#return true if at least two people share a birthday, false otherwise

birthday_match = function(n) {
  #randomly drawing n birthdays from 1 to 365
  birthdays = sample(1:365, size = n, replace = TRUE) 
  
  return(any(duplicated(birthdays)))
}

```


Creating data frame
```{r}
simulation_results = data.frame(
  group_size = 2:50,
  probability = numeric(length(group_size)) #initialize column of zeros
)
```

Running simulations
```{r}
for (i in 1:nrow(simulation_results)) {

  n = simulation_results$group_size[i] #getting group size n for the current row
  trials = replicate(10000, birthday_match(n)) 
  simulation_results$probability[i] = mean(trials) #calculating probability by finding the mean
}
```

Making plot
```{r}
ggplot(simulation_results, aes(x = group_size, y = probability)) +
  geom_line(color = "blue") +
  geom_point(color = "blue") +
  labs(
    title = "The Birthday Problem: Simulation Results",
    subtitle = paste("Based on 10,000 trials per group size"),
    x = "Number of People in Group",
    y = "Probability of at Least One Shared Birthday"
  )
```

Based on this plot, we can see that the probability of at least two people in the group sharing a birthday steadily increases as the number of people in the group increases and almost 100% chance when there are 50 people in a group.
