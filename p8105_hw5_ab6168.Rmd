```{r}
library(tidyverse)
set.seed(1)
```


## Problem 1

Writing function:
```{r}
#n: number of people in the group
#return true if at least two people share a birthday, false otherwise

birthday_match = function(n) {
  #randomly drawing n birthdays from 1 to 365
  birthdays = sample(1:365, size = n, replace = TRUE) 
  
  return(any(duplicated(birthdays)))
}

```


Creating data frame
```{r}
simulation_results = data.frame(
  group_size = 2:50,
  probability = numeric(length(group_size)) #initialize column of zeros
)
```

Running simulations
```{r}
for (i in 1:nrow(simulation_results)) {

  n = simulation_results$group_size[i] #getting group size n for the current row
  trials = replicate(10000, birthday_match(n)) 
  simulation_results$probability[i] = mean(trials) #calculating probability by finding the mean
}
```

Making plot
```{r}
ggplot(simulation_results, aes(x = group_size, y = probability)) +
  geom_line(color = "blue") +
  geom_point(color = "blue") +
  labs(
    title = "The Birthday Problem: Simulation Results",
    subtitle = paste("Based on 10,000 trials per group size"),
    x = "Number of People in Group",
    y = "Probability of at Least One Shared Birthday"
  )
```

Based on this plot, we can see that the probability of at least two people in the group sharing a birthday steadily increases as the number of people in the group increases and almost 100% chance when there are 50 people in a group.


## Problem 2

Setting design elements
```{r}
n_sample = 30        
sigma = 5       
mu = 0         
n_sims = 5000
alpha_level = 0.05 

sim_mean_sd = function(n = n_sample, mu, sigma) {
  
  sim_data = rnorm(n, mean = mu, sd = sigma)
  result = t.test(sim_data, mu = 0)
  
  # Return the tidy data frame
  return(broom::tidy(result))
}

#Iterating for 5000 datasets
sim_results = map_dfr(1:5000, ~sim_mean_sd(
  n = n_sample,
  mu,
  sigma)
) |> 
  select(estimate, p.value)
